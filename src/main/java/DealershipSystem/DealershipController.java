 * This class manages a list of dealerships and the cars at those dealerships.

 * dealership id to the existing dealership's id. If an incoming car's
 * dealership id does not match a dealership, a new dealership is created and
 * added to the managed list. This class cannot add cars to a dealership if
 * acquiring is not enabled for that dealership. Newly created dealerships have
 * acquiring enabled by default.
